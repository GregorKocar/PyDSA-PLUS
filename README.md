RF Spectrum Analyzer in Python. This is a modified version of PA2OHH's audio spectrum analyzer:  
http://www.qsl.net/pa2ohh/11sa.htm  
  
It is a fork project of Rich Heslip VE3MKC, https://github.com/rheslip/PyDSA
  
It uses National Instruments VISA driver to download samples from the scope, perform FFTs and show the results. I used the PyVISA 1.5 wrapper:

(modifired by Gregor Koƒçar)

I first installed the latest National Instruments VISA runtime:

Next I installed Python 3.x making sure Python was added to the path (this is so you can run python from the command line from any directory):

Check if pip is installed:
pip -V
if not follow this instructions:

Next I updated pip and setuptools as well as installing wheel as recommend on:
http://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing/#install-pip-setuptools-and-wheel
pip3 install setuptools
pip3 install wheel
pip3 install mock

Next I installed pyvisa version 1.5 as recommend (the mock update above made this work):

pip3 install pyvisa==1.5


pip3 install numpy
pip install Pillow

Next I downloaded the PyDSA code from Github:

https://github.com/GregorKocar/PyDSA-PLUS

The file to run is in the PyDSA-PLUS directory and is called PyDSA.pyw
